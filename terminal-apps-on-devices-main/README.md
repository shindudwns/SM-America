# Apps on Devices integration

This repository contains a sample app that demonstrates best practices for writing an [Apps on Devices](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/overview) integration.

The app demonstrates the following
- How to discover and connect the handoff reader
- How to collect and confirm a payment
- How to deep link to the device's admin settings

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the integration, ensure you have the following
- Stripe S700 DevKit smart reader
- [Android Studio Flamingo](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases) or greater

## Setup

### Clone the repo

Clone this repo and open it in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Deploy the Example Terminal Backend
The Apps on Devices example app depends on the [Example Terminal Backend](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend).

We recommend deploying the backend to Render.com.

1. Set up a free [Render account](https://dashboard.render.com/register) if you haven't created one previously.
2. Click the button below to deploy the backend. You'll be prompted to enter a name for the Render service group as well as your Stripe API test mode secret key.
3. Go to the [next steps](#next-steps) in this README for how to use this app

### Point the example app to your backend

Edit `local.properties` and add an entry for `BACKEND_URL`. For example if your instance is available at `https://my-backend-123.onrender.com`, you'll add the following.

```
BACKEND_URL=https://my-backend-123.onrender.com
```

## Run

Run the example app on a Stripe S700 DevKit smart reader.
